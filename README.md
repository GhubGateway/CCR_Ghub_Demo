# CCR/Ghub Jupyter Notebook Demo

This Jupyter Notebook provides a demonstration and scripts for executing jobs in parallel on the University at Buffalo (UB)'s Center For Computational Research (CCR)'s high performance compute cluster, UB-HPC. 

On CCR, sbatch and Slurm commands are used to execute the parallel jobs.

On Ghub, the Pegasus Workflow Management System (WMS) is used to execute the parallel jobs.
